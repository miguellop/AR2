# AR2 Workspace

Minimal project scaffold created by workspace setup.

Structure:

- `src/` - source files
- `tests/` - unit tests
- `.vscode/` - editor recommendations and settings

Quick start (Python):

```bash
# Run the sample tests
python3 -m unittest discover -v
```

Replace language-specific files as needed.
